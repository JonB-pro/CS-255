# CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    The client, DriverPass, requested a system for drivers in training designed to allow these students to 
    register an account, request appointments, and reserve times to practice driving with a driver. It also 
    needed to have secure accounts that could be locked after multiple failed login attempts, a changelog that 
    the boss could access to observe any issues or modifications to the system, and be updateable with any 
    new information provided by the DMV.

What did you do particularly well?

    I think I designed the login and security system around user accounts well. I also think the general 
    design of the system was good.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    I would revise the technical requirements, and add more details as to what the requirements of the 
    system are. Currently, I just have vague bullet points on what the system would generally need to run 
    well, not detailed specs on what it should run on.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    The user's needs included account creation and modification, changelog access, appointment reservation 
    and creation, and system modification and maintenance. I implemented these through the ability to make 
    and edit accounts by multiple users, the ability for the boss account to access and print out a changelog, 
    appointment creation and reservation by students or the secretary, and modification and maintenance access 
    to the system by the IT Admin. These needs are important to consider in system design, because if the 
    user doesn't have features they need to accomplish the goal of the system, then there is no point in 
    creating the system in the first place.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    Software design begins with asking what is needed and wanted by the client, then adding any other needs 
    that will support reaching the goals of the system. Next, the design needs to be broken down and identified 
    by its parts, including functional and non-functional requirements, the way the user will access the 
    system, and the assumptions and limitations of the proposed system. Then the system needs to be mapped 
    out in terms of what is in the system, how the system flows, how the system interacts with its users 
    over time, and the different ways a user can access the system and what they can do inside it. 
    Finally, using all this information, the final design of the system can be agreed upon and presented 
    to the client for final confirmation. The techniques I would use in future analysis are in person 
    meetings and design documents, as meetings with the clients will help determine requirements and design 
    documents may give me ideas on how to design a system if something similar has already been created.
